**Describe an example of a theoretical tool (for you) that you could use to make an artwork (or dance, theater piece, music, film, etc - depending on your interest and creative practice). What would the tool do? What kind of functions would it have? What might it be called? What limit might it have that would require you to step in and collaborate with your software-tool to finish the piece?**

My theoretical tool would be the ideal template generator. It would cater to aiding creator's block in aural, visual, and conceptual spaces. I would call it Tempo, and the goal is to input a couple certian key words or randomize the inputs completely, then outputs of sounds, images, teplate themes, mood boards, or worded concepts are made. Specifically for me, in its aural sense, you could input a scale, instruments, and moods. For visual, inputs would be key words, colors, patterens, and symbols. And for concepts, it would just be key words that output them back into new phrases for think piece inspirations or creating and idea in any medium. As for the human input, besides the actual imput, you would be required to finish the products on your own or develop them more since it would be a tool for you form your work around.

**Write about using NoPaint. Is it your artwork? Are you the collaborator? Are you incidental? What role does randomness play in this art? Or in your art in general? your life in general?**

For NoPaint, I would consider it half of my artwork since I am partially controlling what happens in a sequential process. Unlike ARRON, this for of art reqiures you to continuosly get involved in the process. Therefore, I would consider myself a collaborator. Randomness plays a big role. You can't really tell what is the next thing to pop up on the screen, from a bug moving to the rezise of the screen. In my life, I like to think there are a lot of random things that happen around me because I feel like that's the energy I attract. It intrigues me because I am a random person my self since I spead myself thin across many forms of media and interests.

In this code, I was in charge of coding the player's movement. When I made that, one of my partners remade the code to fit it for the player class. I contributed to other ideas on how we would impliment the other requirments like how to make the grass and increasing player squirrel size. One difficulty we had was trying to stop the player size from continuously growing past the screen. We changed that buy slowing the growth rate of the player squirrel. Our version of Squirrel Eat Squirrel seems to stick close to the parameters of the requirements and plays well to conveniency.

A few advanced things that were added:
- Robot
- Perlin noise to player movement
- Squirrels avoiding vegetation
- Sprint (group made)

# 5/10/21 - Final Project

https://editor.p5js.org/HaxxALot/sketches/v4LpAiI91

My project embodies the represents the general course of action of having a bad day. They start out good but get worse through out, and I decided to use phrases inspired my movies, general thoughts, and fake deep takes. Each run of the code will randomize these phrases as the backgroud gradually fades from white, to a bright color, than dark, then black to metaphorically align with the text.
Some challenges I had with this project were how to randomize the background color, how to control the color fading, and reseting the page. For each respective challenge, I made a variable for each RGB value and subtracted each one at random values, used the keyPressed function to subtract and add (go from light to dark; vise versa) to the color scale, and I used keyTyped to reset each changing value to its original value.
At first, I was going to do a sprite sheet of a person walking from middle screen left to screen right, while having the background change colors of the whole rainbow (each color filled the screen), and each color would represent an emotion they would react to.
