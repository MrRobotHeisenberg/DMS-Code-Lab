**Describe an example of a theoretical tool (for you) that you could use to make an artwork (or dance, theater piece, music, film, etc - depending on your interest and creative practice). What would the tool do? What kind of functions would it have? What might it be called? What limit might it have that would require you to step in and collaborate with your software-tool to finish the piece?**

My theoretical tool would be the ideal template generator. It would cater to aiding creator's block in aural, visual, and conceptual spaces. I would call it Tempo, and the goal is to input a couple certian key words or randomize the inputs completely, then outputs of sounds, images, teplate themes, mood boards, or worded concepts are made. Specifically for me, in its aural sense, you could input a scale, instruments, and moods. For visual, inputs would be key words, colors, patterens, and symbols. And for concepts, it would just be key words that output them back into new phrases for think piece inspirations or creating and idea in any medium. As for the human input, besides the actual imput, you would be required to finish the products on your own or develop them more since it would be a tool for you form your work around.

**Write about using NoPaint. Is it your artwork? Are you the collaborator? Are you incidental? What role does randomness play in this art? Or in your art in general? your life in general?**

For NoPaint, I would consider it half of my artwork since I am partially controlling what happens in a sequential process. Unlike ARRON, this for of art reqiures you to continuosly get involved in the process. Therefore, I would consider myself a collaborator. Randomness plays a big role. You can't really tell what is the next thing to pop up on the screen, from a bug moving to the rezise of the screen. In my life, I like to think there are a lot of random things that happen around me because I feel like that's the energy I attract. It intrigues me because I am a random person my self since I spead myself thin across many forms of media and interests.
